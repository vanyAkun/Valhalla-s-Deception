# Valhalla-s-Deception
First group project done at university, developed in Monogame.
It tells the story of Ragnar, a Viking god that has to save his family and reclaim his throne from other gods who betrayed him.
The genre of VD is a platformer, hackÂ & slash kind of game with 3 different levels and cutscenes.
The end will leave you shocked!
